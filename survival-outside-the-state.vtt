00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.389
How to survive outside of the state

2
00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:07.502
Advanced privacy, sovereignty and
censorship-resistance techniques

3
00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:08.865
which work today

4
00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:11.521
The current system is broken

5
00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:15.520
The state has total control over
the white market economy

6
00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:19.974
The state's largest mechanism
for surveillance and censorship

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.290
is the government ID system,
also known as KYC

8
00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:26.770
The state forces employers, landlords

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.816
doctors, banks, ISPs, cell providers

10
00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.107
mailmen and even gyms and libraries

11
00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:34.943
to require government ID

12
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.776
Without a passport or driver's license

13
00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.866
it becomes difficult to find
a job or a place to live

14
00:00:41.714 --> 00:00:44.202
Not only does this put innocent people

15
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:45.731
under constant state surveillance

16
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.650
it also excludes approximately

17
00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:50.166
1 billion people worldwide
from the economy

18
00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:52.536
KYC isn't only about

19
00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:53.889
"handing over your data"

20
00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:55.802
If that would be the case

21
00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:57.959
it would be enough to
simply say your name

22
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.181
or fill out a form

23
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.570
Instead

24
00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:02.697
only people with a
state-assigned document

25
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:04.056
are permitted to take part

26
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.707
The state's monopoly on identity

27
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.590
ignores reality, in favor of

28
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.334
gatekept databases
and centralized control

29
00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:15.434
Fortunately, agorism
bypasses the state's systems

30
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:16.964
and allows everyone to take part in

31
00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:18.764
free and fair markets

32
00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:21.452
With agorism, you can find work

33
00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:23.231
rent apartments, receive healthcare

34
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:24.207
and more

35
00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:27.084
no government ID
or state permit required

36
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:29.408
One problem with

37
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.972
the state's monopoly on identity

38
00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:32.086
is surveillance

39
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:33.597
which stretches far beyond

40
00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.713
the tracking and
surveillance capitalism

41
00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:36.584
of Big Tech

42
00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:39.056
Via government ID systems

43
00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:40.939
the state tracks innocent people

44
00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:43.202
from birth certificate
to death certificate

45
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.517
It compiles databases of

46
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.723
names, birth dates, photos

47
00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:50.760
home addresses, jobs, bank balances

48
00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:52.565
medical records and more

49
00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:55.065
Which it shares with third parties

50
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.281
without the individual's
knowledge or consent

51
00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.534
This level of data collection
is unnecessary

52
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:02.409
For example

53
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.167
Buying bread or a bus ticket

54
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.929
with cash doesn't require a name

55
00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:08.398
Medical records should stay between

56
00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:09.629
the doctor and patient

57
00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:12.607
Many people only share
their home address

58
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.213
with close friends and family

59
00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:16.504
Government ID requirements

60
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.127
can also put people in danger

61
00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:20.283
such as people who
are escaping from abuse

62
00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:22.319
or activists who are
using a pseudonym

63
00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:23.462
for safety reasons

64
00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.536
What is worse than surveillance

65
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:27.782
is total censorship

66
00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:30.450
The state actively refuses

67
00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:32.455
to print ID for millions of people

68
00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:34.664
which shuts them out of
the mainstream economy

69
00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.454
and makes it difficult to survive

70
00:02:37.432 --> 00:02:39.385
If your country of birth or residence

71
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.346
refuses to print a birth certificate

72
00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:43.910
passport or national ID card for you

73
00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:46.377
there is nowhere to go
and no appeals

74
00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:48.461
Even if you have witnesses

75
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:49.869
are a skilled worker

76
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.535
can prove your identity
via non-government records

77
00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.612
or are willing to give fingerprints

78
00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:56.680
there is no way to convince the state

79
00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.315
to enter you into its database

80
00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:00.244
In most cases

81
00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:02.934
this problem starts at birth
or early adulthood

82
00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:05.300
and the individual has
done nothing wrong

83
00:03:06.168 --> 00:03:08.898
NGOs like Red Cross and United Nations

84
00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:11.007
are aware of the exclusion
and discrimination

85
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:13.098
caused by government ID systems

86
00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:15.299
but they are unable to
convince the state

87
00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:17.125
nor offer alternative IDs

88
00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:20.628
Jurisdictional arbitrage
like Flag Theory

89
00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:22.664
requires an already existing ID

90
00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.484
Even the Californian driver's license

91
00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:27.376
for undocumented people

92
00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:29.576
requires an existing international passport

93
00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:31.607
or ID card from another country

94
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.359
Old strategies like paper tripping

95
00:03:34.408 --> 00:03:35.708
no longer work

96
00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:39.090
It's difficult to find so-called
corrupt bureaucrats

97
00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.197
who would print ID for you
under-the-table

98
00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:42.971
In many countries

99
00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:45.499
it's difficult to find fake ID vendors

100
00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:47.096
and if you can find one

101
00:03:47.134 --> 00:03:49.115
it may not work to
open a bank account

102
00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:50.448
or find a job

103
00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:54.033
Ignored, blamed and even
criminalized by the state

104
00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:56.564
millions of people are left
on the edge of society

105
00:03:56.613 --> 00:03:58.843
without recourse and
with great difficulty to

106
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.481
even earn money or
find a place to live

107
00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:05.138
Authoritarianism is increasing globally

108
00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:06.942
Every year

109
00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:09.247
more services require government ID

110
00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:11.084
shutting people without ID

111
00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.208
or who need privacy or pseudonymity

112
00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:14.535
further out of the economy

113
00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:16.893
During corona statism

114
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:20.564
vaccine passports required
not only an untested vaccine

115
00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:22.841
but also an existing government ID

116
00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:24.780
In some countries

117
00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:27.922
cops and soldiers patrolled
the streets during lockdowns

118
00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.046
and demanded ID from innocent people

119
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:32.323
As is clear to most people

120
00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:35.086
this wasn't about health,
but about control

121
00:04:35.701 --> 00:04:37.877
Digital IDs and CBDCs

122
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.953
will make it worse

123
00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.625
The claim that digital IDs
will help unbanked people

124
00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.508
is a lie that uses vulnerable
people as an excuse

125
00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:48.520
while continuing to deny
them access to the economy

126
00:04:49.472 --> 00:04:51.035
Just like the current system

127
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.850
access to Digital IDs and CBDCs

128
00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:56.874
will require an existing entry
in the state's database

129
00:04:57.668 --> 00:05:00.108
Giving your name and fingerprints
will not be enough

130
00:05:00.178 --> 00:05:02.276
if you weren't already
registered at birth

131
00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:05.443
If the state really wanted
to promote inclusion

132
00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.229
it would remove the
barriers to obtaining ID

133
00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:10.669
or remove ID requirements entirely

134
00:05:11.457 --> 00:05:13.748
There is nothing blocking
the state from this

135
00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.162
The exclusion is intentional

136
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.221
and the system is working as designed

137
00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:21.259
If the goal was indeed
mass surveillance

138
00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:24.417
or even profiteering from
money printing and taxation

139
00:05:24.463 --> 00:05:27.718
the state would have no issue with
entering people into its database

140
00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:29.723
In reality

141
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.801
the state's pathological desire to
bully, deprive and ostracize

142
00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:36.899
is stronger than its desire
to simply surveil and profit

143
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:39.850
The pervasiveness of digital ID

144
00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:41.951
will only make survival more difficult

145
00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:43.370
for marginalized people

146
00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.159
For example

147
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.584
if grocery stores only
accept CBDCs to buy food

148
00:05:48.646 --> 00:05:52.125
and access to public transit
requires Digital ID

149
00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:53.596
In addition

150
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.165
even people who currently
have access to ID

151
00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:59.791
are at risk of exclusion from
the upcoming Digital ID system

152
00:06:00.618 --> 00:06:03.108
Corporate deplatforming
is already a huge issue

153
00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:05.575
and a centralized
single point of failure

154
00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.700
like CBDCs will make this worse

155
00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:10.910
Anyone who resists
could easily be cut off

156
00:06:10.978 --> 00:06:12.751
from the statist white market

157
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.548
Agorism is already a necessity
for many people today

158
00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:18.390
and will become vital for many more

159
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.362
as state authoritarianism increases

160
00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:23.175
As you can see

161
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:26.305
government ID is nothing more
than an artificial system

162
00:06:26.347 --> 00:06:28.911
designed to control,
surveil and dehumanize

163
00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:32.750
It should not be possible to
exclude an innocent person

164
00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.186
from the entire economy

165
00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.009
and even push them to homelessness

166
00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:38.332
just because a singular state bureaucrat

167
00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.119
doesn't want to print
a document for them

168
00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.092
Everyone has a name

169
00:06:42.124 --> 00:06:44.622
appearance, background
and personhood

170
00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:47.172
You should not need
the state's permission

171
00:06:47.312 --> 00:06:49.463
in order to have a name
or to exist

172
00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.106
KYC wasn't around forever

173
00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:54.279
Even a few years ago

174
00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:55.978
it was easy to rent an apartment

175
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.268
find work, send a money transfer

176
00:06:58.301 --> 00:06:59.537
or buy a sim card

177
00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:01.704
just by filling out a form
and paying

178
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.098
This authoritarian power grab

179
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.715
is new and unnecessary

180
00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:08.584
Things worked perfectly fine before

181
00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:10.781
Peer-to-peer trust methods

182
00:07:10.817 --> 00:07:13.302
are more inclusive, humane
and work better

183
00:07:14.152 --> 00:07:16.034
This can be as simple as
saying your name

184
00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:17.887
using a PIN to pickup mail

185
00:07:17.912 --> 00:07:20.208
a vouch or portfolio to get a job

186
00:07:20.252 --> 00:07:22.171
or a cash deposit for a rental

187
00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:25.882
Instead of relying on
state permission

188
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.879
agorist markets provide a
much-needed alternative method

189
00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.875
to find work, housing,
healthcare and more

190
00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:34.549
Agorism has worked since decades

191
00:07:34.602 --> 00:07:36.850
including in authoritarian regimes

192
00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:38.501
where it is needed the most

193
00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:41.050
Agorist markets are also known as

194
00:07:41.098 --> 00:07:42.361
gray and black markets

195
00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:43.960
the informal economy

196
00:07:44.034 --> 00:07:44.995
the underground

197
00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:46.164
and Second Realms

198
00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:49.650
There are many reasons to
bypass state regulations

199
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.744
when doing business

200
00:07:50.957 --> 00:07:52.681
such as saving time and money

201
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.014
avoiding censorship or restrictions

202
00:07:55.062 --> 00:07:56.554
protecting your privacy

203
00:07:56.596 --> 00:07:59.218
or ideological
or humanitarian reasons

204
00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:02.706
Agorism focuses on
peer-to-peer transactions

205
00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:04.993
small businesses and communities

206
00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:07.493
No need for a global revolution

207
00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:08.942
or corporate mass adoption

208
00:08:09.796 --> 00:08:12.323
If you can get what you need
from agorist markets

209
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:15.246
you don't need to worry about
what the mainstream market is doing

210
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.312
Found an apartment for cash?
That's winning

211
00:08:19.983 --> 00:08:22.931
Earn crypto online?
That's winning

212
00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.475
Agorism is there for
those who need it

213
00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:28.732
and every transaction
outside of the state is a win

214
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.400
Agorism helps you to
build independence

215
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.009
from the games of the state,
large corporations and geopolitics

216
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.894
which the individual can't influence

217
00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:40.315
and instead focuses on local
and global small businesses

218
00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:41.436
and communities

219
00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:43.354
where the individual's voice counts

220
00:08:44.212 --> 00:08:46.316
Good people disobey unjust laws

221
00:08:47.012 --> 00:08:49.207
A hotel owner who doesn't require ID

222
00:08:49.254 --> 00:08:50.869
can save someone from homelessness

223
00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:53.007
or help them to escape from abuse

224
00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:55.745
An agorist doctor can save lives

225
00:08:56.627 --> 00:08:58.517
A seller of anonymous sim cards

226
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.873
can help people to keep
in touch with loved ones

227
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.475
or help an activist to
fight for human rights

228
00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:07.845
There are multiple ways to
run an agorist business

229
00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:10.600
The Gray Man strategy is when

230
00:09:10.638 --> 00:09:12.584
a state-registered
white market business

231
00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.970
offers agorist services
under-the-table

232
00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:16.496
to trusted customers

233
00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:17.962
Some examples

234
00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:20.772
A phone repair store sells
anonymous sim cards

235
00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:21.600
on request

236
00:09:22.282 --> 00:09:24.597
A hotel rents out rooms
without ID

237
00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:25.665
to people in need

238
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.631
such as victims of abuse
or undocumented people

239
00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:32.148
A restaurant hires a chef
for cash under-the-table

240
00:09:32.192 --> 00:09:33.670
so that they can pay rent

241
00:09:34.322 --> 00:09:37.969
A doctor agrees to treat an
out-of-pocket patient without ID

242
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.860
Proxy merchants are

243
00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:42.898
individuals or businesses
that have access to ID

244
00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:45.621
and allow people to use
their company as a proxy

245
00:09:45.647 --> 00:09:47.679
to access services anonymously

246
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.342
An example is

247
00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:51.448
a friend who sends a
bank transfer for you

248
00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:53.052
and you repay them in Bitcoin

249
00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:56.806
Your roommate deals with the
rental contract on your behalf

250
00:09:56.845 --> 00:09:58.717
and you pay rent to them in cash

251
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.621
A local business allows you
to pickup mail there

252
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:05.145
A company registers sim cards
under their name

253
00:10:05.164 --> 00:10:06.597
and resells them anonymously

254
00:10:07.722 --> 00:10:09.077
Second Realm businesses

255
00:10:09.104 --> 00:10:11.468
operate entirely
outside of the state

256
00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:14.148
without government ID
or a registered company

257
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.116
Such as remote freelancing
for Bitcoin

258
00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:18.509
or lawncare for cash

259
00:10:19.187 --> 00:10:22.533
Importing medicine from countries
that don't require prescriptions

260
00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:25.658
Selling your old car in Craigslist

261
00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:29.139
Renting out your apartment for cash
while you are traveling

262
00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:32.926
Now some practical examples

263
00:10:32.948 --> 00:10:35.575
covering food, finances, jobs

264
00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:37.708
housing, healthcare, energy

265
00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:40.772
logistics, communications, education

266
00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:43.376
community and how you
can get started today

267
00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:45.161
Starting with food

268
00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:47.507
It's still possible to buy
food with cash

269
00:10:47.532 --> 00:10:49.057
in mainstream grocery stores

270
00:10:49.894 --> 00:10:53.041
Even when corona restrictions
closed most other stores

271
00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:56.277
or demanded contactless payments
such as credit cards

272
00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.954
and banking apps
(which all require ID)

273
00:10:58.982 --> 00:11:01.075
most grocery stores stayed open

274
00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:03.175
didn't require vaccine passports

275
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:05.108
and continued to accept cash

276
00:11:05.955 --> 00:11:08.668
However, it's still important
to grow independence

277
00:11:08.693 --> 00:11:10.076
from large corporations

278
00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:12.726
and support small businesses
and local farms

279
00:11:13.482 --> 00:11:15.248
Whether that's growing your own food

280
00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:17.373
and getting water from a well
on a homestead

281
00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:18.903
or buying from farmers markets

282
00:11:20.018 --> 00:11:22.989
There are even farmers who
accept Bitcoin and Monero

283
00:11:23.108 --> 00:11:24.715
such as Gratuitas coffee

284
00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:25.776
and Beef Initiative

285
00:11:26.608 --> 00:11:27.308
In the future

286
00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:29.960
if the state would force
mainstream grocery stores

287
00:11:29.987 --> 00:11:31.918
to only accept CBDCs

288
00:11:31.955 --> 00:11:34.618
local grocery stores who
accept cash or crypto

289
00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:37.182
would become vital
for access to food

290
00:11:37.659 --> 00:11:38.359
In addition

291
00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:41.155
proxy merchants who
have access to CBDCs

292
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:43.214
could go shopping for
unbanked people

293
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.225
Without government ID

294
00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:48.322
it's impossible to open
a bank account

295
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:49.617
or get a credit card

296
00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:51.827
It wasn't always like this

297
00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:53.869
It used to be possible to

298
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.089
open a Paypal account

299
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.754
buy a Visa gift card

300
00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:58.262
or send a Western Union transfer

301
00:11:58.295 --> 00:11:59.211
without ID

302
00:12:00.192 --> 00:12:03.084
Now, you can't even send
20 dollars to a friend

303
00:12:03.148 --> 00:12:05.646
if you don't have a
passport or driver's license

304
00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:10.197
Thankfully, cash still works
for local in person transactions

305
00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:13.503
and some online stores still
accept cash on delivery

306
00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:14.643
or cash by mail

307
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.903
Some online stores
accept gift cards

308
00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:20.324
that you can buy with cash
from local stores

309
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:22.817
In some countries like the US

310
00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:25.710
anonymous Visa gift cards
are still available

311
00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:29.422
Physical gold and silver
work well as savings

312
00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:32.674
Proxy merchants can
send bank transfers

313
00:12:32.728 --> 00:12:35.459
pay bills or purchase
products on your behalf

314
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:37.618
and you pay them
in cash or crypto

315
00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:40.938
The most important tool
for financial freedom

316
00:12:40.974 --> 00:12:42.064
is cryptocurrencies

317
00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:46.159
Bitcoin and Monero make it possible
to send and receive money

318
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:49.188
worldwide, without
government ID or a bank account

319
00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.741
Perfect for online shopping

320
00:12:51.782 --> 00:12:53.015
brick-and-mortar stores

321
00:12:53.297 --> 00:12:53.997
remittances

322
00:12:54.103 --> 00:12:56.299
jobs, fundraising, tips

323
00:12:56.556 --> 00:12:57.821
savings and more

324
00:12:58.563 --> 00:13:00.511
Many individuals and businesses

325
00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:03.501
are building Bitcoin and Monero
circular economies

326
00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:06.519
which aim to make it possible
to live fully on crypto

327
00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:10.608
including food, jobs, housing,
healthcare and travel

328
00:13:12.512 --> 00:13:14.311
In order to pay for food and rent

329
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:15.634
you need a way to earn money

330
00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:18.766
Sadly the state also has a monopoly

331
00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.315
over the mainstream job market

332
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.717
Despite your skills

333
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.224
work ethic and effort

334
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:25.360
if you don't have ID

335
00:13:25.403 --> 00:13:28.538
most employers won't even
consider to hire you

336
00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:29.854
Fortunately

337
00:13:29.936 --> 00:13:31.733
there are many agorist employers

338
00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:34.502
who value meritocracy
and equal opportunities

339
00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.404
If you can do the job,
they are happy to hire you

340
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.991
Some examples are

341
00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:42.091
under-the-table jobs for cash

342
00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:42.849
for example

343
00:13:42.877 --> 00:13:46.361
in construction, farming,
factory work, restaurants

344
00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:49.315
or selling products
for cash in local markets

345
00:13:50.065 --> 00:13:50.907
Additionally

346
00:13:50.948 --> 00:13:53.021
there's remote work
for cryptocurrencies

347
00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:55.045
including software development

348
00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:58.416
graphic design, music,
writing and translation

349
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.674
It's possible to find
remote work for crypto

350
00:14:01.719 --> 00:14:04.158
in KYC-free freelancing platforms

351
00:14:04.194 --> 00:14:06.575
like Microlancer
and Freelance For Coins

352
00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.633
as well as in peer-to-peer
marketplaces

353
00:14:08.663 --> 00:14:12.388
like Bitejo and Bitcoin P2P
Marketplace in Telegram

354
00:14:13.298 --> 00:14:16.179
Co-ops and collectives
also offer agorist jobs

355
00:14:17.217 --> 00:14:17.917
For example

356
00:14:17.974 --> 00:14:19.547
a bicycle repair co-op

357
00:14:19.597 --> 00:14:20.996
or a cafe collective

358
00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:23.562
DAOs are similar to co-ops

359
00:14:23.608 --> 00:14:27.287
and can be used for projects,
jobs, fundraising and more

360
00:14:28.198 --> 00:14:31.249
For agorist DAOs, check Dark Fi

361
00:14:32.628 --> 00:14:33.969
Shelter is important

362
00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:36.201
Protection from the elements

363
00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:37.398
a place to sleep

364
00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:40.084
relax, feel safe, and call home

365
00:14:40.572 --> 00:14:42.275
But even a necessity like this

366
00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:44.910
is gatekept behind
government ID KYC

367
00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:47.650
Peer-to-peer rentals help people to

368
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.614
access shelter outside of the state

369
00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:53.248
Whether it's renting for cash
from a guy in Craigslist

370
00:14:53.397 --> 00:14:56.622
living with roommates who deal
with the contract on your behalf

371
00:14:56.704 --> 00:14:59.766
finding an AirBnB host
who doesn't require ID

372
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.627
or joining an intentional community

373
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:04.099
like a housing project
or an eco village

374
00:15:05.003 --> 00:15:08.223
Proxy merchants could help people
to rent white market apartments

375
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:10.283
while a crypto-friendly AirBnB

376
00:15:10.336 --> 00:15:13.417
could help people to rent short-term
and long-term accommodation

377
00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:15.117
for Bitcoin or Monero

378
00:15:15.719 --> 00:15:18.150
Intentional communities
like eco villages

379
00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:19.330
and Bitcoin Citadels

380
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.031
could provide an autonomous space

381
00:15:21.096 --> 00:15:22.957
where people could live,
work and thrive

382
00:15:22.996 --> 00:15:24.682
outside of state control

383
00:15:26.674 --> 00:15:28.007
Even if you pay with cash

384
00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:31.481
and write your contact details
and medical history on the form

385
00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:34.097
doctors may refuse to
treat you without ID

386
00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:37.123
Not only is this against
the Hippocratic Oath

387
00:15:37.324 --> 00:15:39.020
it also puts people in danger

388
00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.058
and unable to seek healthcare

389
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.410
Fortunately

390
00:15:42.438 --> 00:15:44.428
it's still possible to find doctors

391
00:15:44.484 --> 00:15:45.717
who don't require ID

392
00:15:45.763 --> 00:15:48.119
via word-of-mouth
or support groups

393
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.605
Generally this requires
out-of-pocket payment

394
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.902
but there are also some
charitable health clinics

395
00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:55.207
funded by donations

396
00:15:55.262 --> 00:15:59.161
where people in need can receive
free or low cost treatment

397
00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.341
A Bitcoin health insurance company

398
00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:03.566
and network of
Bitcoin-friendly doctors

399
00:16:03.603 --> 00:16:06.627
could help people to access
healthcare for an affordable price

400
00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:08.685
as well as print
health insurance cards

401
00:16:08.723 --> 00:16:12.141
that people can use to visit
doctors without government ID

402
00:16:12.557 --> 00:16:14.497
A Bitcoin GoFundMe alternative

403
00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:16.503
could also help individuals
and charities

404
00:16:16.528 --> 00:16:18.399
to raise money for medical expenses

405
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.716
It's also possible to

406
00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:23.976
import medicine from countries
that don't require prescriptions

407
00:16:24.004 --> 00:16:27.148
such as buying from an
international online pharmacy

408
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.968
This helps people to
access the medicine

409
00:16:29.993 --> 00:16:31.599
that they need to survive

410
00:16:32.037 --> 00:16:32.737
In addition

411
00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:36.113
biohackers are making it easier
to DIY your own healthcare

412
00:16:37.077 --> 00:16:39.091
Four Thieves Vinegar
is working on ways

413
00:16:39.117 --> 00:16:42.293
to synthesize medicines from
freely purchasable re-agents

414
00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:43.892
and advances are being made

415
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.051
in robotic surgery and CRISPR

416
00:16:47.922 --> 00:16:51.060
Often, electricity and heating
is included in rentals

417
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:53.253
and the landlord makes the contract

418
00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:54.327
with the energy company

419
00:16:54.377 --> 00:16:55.497
on your behalf

420
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.946
However, it's useful to
build energy sovereignty

421
00:16:59.014 --> 00:17:01.449
especially in times of
increasing prices

422
00:17:01.493 --> 00:17:03.249
or even risks of blackouts

423
00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.206
Off-grid solar panels
and batteries

424
00:17:06.243 --> 00:17:08.073
can help you achieve
energy sovereignty

425
00:17:08.968 --> 00:17:11.057
Generate electricity from sunlight

426
00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:12.770
even on a cloudy winter day

427
00:17:12.889 --> 00:17:15.196
and store it in batteries
for later usage

428
00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:17.629
Even an emergency hand crank

429
00:17:17.678 --> 00:17:18.800
or pedal generator

430
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.721
could help you to
recharge your phone

431
00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:22.539
or listen to the radio
during a blackout

432
00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:25.587
Gas generators and
propane heaters

433
00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:27.871
can also give you
independence from the grid

434
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.292
Although there is still dependence on

435
00:17:30.326 --> 00:17:32.514
oligarchs and national supply lines

436
00:17:32.544 --> 00:17:34.027
you can buy gas in advance

437
00:17:34.083 --> 00:17:35.475
and use it during a blackout

438
00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:38.160
when the grid is
inaccessible or rationed

439
00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:39.533
In the future

440
00:17:39.738 --> 00:17:41.063
community-run energy grids

441
00:17:41.108 --> 00:17:43.713
and improvements in renewables
and battery tech

442
00:17:43.757 --> 00:17:45.872
could make it easier
to live independently

443
00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:47.456
from the state's energy grid

444
00:17:49.489 --> 00:17:50.503
It can be difficult

445
00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:52.622
to receive mail without ID

446
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.663
If you are living in an
informal apartment rental

447
00:17:55.697 --> 00:17:58.105
it may not be possible
to receive mail there

448
00:17:58.155 --> 00:18:00.926
and most PO box
services require ID

449
00:18:01.797 --> 00:18:03.146
Depending on where you live

450
00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:05.604
there may be courier-operated
parcel lockers

451
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:08.581
that only require a PIN
that you receive by SMS

452
00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:11.703
or general delivery may be
possible with a passphrase

453
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.263
Some taxi apps offer
delivery services

454
00:18:15.296 --> 00:18:16.507
and accept cash

455
00:18:16.551 --> 00:18:18.413
which works for local deliveries

456
00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:20.183
In some cases

457
00:18:20.249 --> 00:18:22.877
you could ask the taxi driver
to pickup the package

458
00:18:22.914 --> 00:18:25.261
from the post office
on your behalf

459
00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.941
It's also possible to

460
00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:28.987
simply ask a friend
or local business

461
00:18:29.036 --> 00:18:30.719
if they could receive
the package for you

462
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.096
In the future

463
00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:34.416
a KYC-free PO box network

464
00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:36.271
could help people to receive mail

465
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:37.824
In this concept

466
00:18:37.881 --> 00:18:40.752
local businesses could
sign up as PO box providers

467
00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:42.902
and set their own fees and terms

468
00:18:43.686 --> 00:18:45.939
Then customers could
send mail to this address

469
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.841
and pick it up with a passphrase

470
00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:50.999
Access to the internet

471
00:18:51.072 --> 00:18:53.394
is also gatekept behind
government ID

472
00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:56.905
Most home internet
providers require ID

473
00:18:56.999 --> 00:18:58.465
although in some rentals

474
00:18:58.494 --> 00:19:01.349
the landlord deals with
the contract on your behalf

475
00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.092
In many countries

476
00:19:03.288 --> 00:19:05.915
even prepaid sim cards require ID

477
00:19:05.953 --> 00:19:09.600
but some stores still sell anonymous
sim cards under-the-table

478
00:19:10.247 --> 00:19:12.270
It's possible to access the internet

479
00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:15.565
by importing a sim card from a
country that doesn't require ID

480
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:17.396
such as the US or UK

481
00:19:17.474 --> 00:19:19.955
using an anonymous e-sim
like Silent Link

482
00:19:19.991 --> 00:19:22.511
or making use of
public wifi networks

483
00:19:23.053 --> 00:19:26.048
With more proxy merchants
and public wifi providers

484
00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:28.026
uncensored access to the internet

485
00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:29.885
would be possible for everyone

486
00:19:31.616 --> 00:19:33.740
Access to education and training

487
00:19:33.788 --> 00:19:35.353
is also censored by the state

488
00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.061
Universities, trade schools
and libraries

489
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.380
require government ID,
even if you pay in cash

490
00:19:42.908 --> 00:19:43.608
Thankfully

491
00:19:43.644 --> 00:19:45.858
there are accessible ways
to learn new skills

492
00:19:46.086 --> 00:19:47.834
such as with online education

493
00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:50.122

outside of the state's
monopoly on education

510
00:20:30.014 --> 00:20:33.745

for example in Twitter, Telegram,
Reddit and Matrix

products and services

517
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.037
outside of the state

518
00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:55.467
Spread the word about agorism

519
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.520
and help to build
fair and free markets

520
00:20:57.553 --> 00:20:59.376
that everyone can participate in

521
00:21:01.118 --> 00:21:02.009
How to get started?

522
00:21:03.074 --> 00:21:06.185

or join a crypto
peer-to-peer marketplace

Offer proxy merchant
services if possible

527
00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:21.741
Build parallel economies that
operate outside of the state

528
00:21:21.832 --> 00:21:24.983
and are future-proof against
the dangers of CBDCs

529
00:21:25.021 --> 00:21:28.252
digital IDs and increasing
state authoritarianism

530
00:21:29.209 --> 00:21:31.115
