Crypto Agorism

2
00:00:03.062 --> 00:00:04.939
Free markets for a free world

3
00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:09.580
This presentation introduces Crypto Agorism

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.714
what it is

5
00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:12.040
and how it helps people today

6
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:14.174
to survive outside of the state

7
00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:17.501
and access services without
censorship or surveillance

8
00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:19.456
Important tools are

9
00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:20.609
cryptocurrencies

10
00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:21.715
anonymous services

11
00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:22.825
and gray markets

12
00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:26.890
Agorism means fair and free markets

13
00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.890
that operate outside of the state

14
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.326
No company registration

15
00:00:31.328 --> 00:00:33.410
ID or permits are required

16
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.274
Examples are under-the-table jobs

17
00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:38.038
informal apartment rentals

18
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.556
and anonymous sim cards

19
00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:43.006
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero

20
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.031
are good tools for agorist markets

21
00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.901
Unlike banking

22
00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.262
no government ID or

23
00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:50.393
corporate permission is required

24
00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:52.335
Just download a wallet

25
00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:55.159
and you can send and receive money worldwide

26
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:56.152
without censorship

27
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:59.093
Crypto Agorism unites agorists

28
00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.911
and cryptocurrency users

29
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.659
to build practical free markets

30
00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:06.610
Agorism focuses on small businesses

31
00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:08.677
entrepreneurs and communities

32
00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.743
not state-backed corporations

33
00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:13.756
Small businesses are more flexible

34
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:14.776
offer better

35
00:01:14.778 --> 00:01:16.852
more individualized service

36
00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:20.421
and have a closer relationship
between the buyer and seller

37
00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:23.131
Small businesses can also offer

38
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.373
fairer pay and better working conditions

39
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:27.820
due to direct deals with the producers

40
00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:29.452
and bypassing middlemen

41
00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:31.137
profiteers and CEOs

42
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.962
An example is direct trade coffee vs. Nestle

43
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.391
Agorism helps you to bypass

44
00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:40.123
the state's monopolies on money

45
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.602
identity and markets

46
00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:44.608
which attempt to censor and surveil
the free market

47
00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.747
Fiat such as the US dollar

48
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.659
is the state's monopoly on money

49
00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:52.701
The state can print more money limitlessly

50
00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:54.383
and manipulate the economy

51
00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.534
The state also forces

52
00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:58.772
government ID requirements onto banks

53
00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:01.659
which excludes millions of people without ID

54
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.594
and surveils the financial transactions
of everyone else

55
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.268
As the state is phasing out cash

56
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.969
and planning to introduce
gatekept and surveilled CBDCs

57
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:12.989
a free currency is necessary

58
00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.072
Cryptocurrencies are the answer

59
00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:18.817
Crypto operates outside of the state

60
00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:20.310
No country

61
00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:22.079
corporation or individual

62
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:23.903
controls the network or issuance

63
00:02:24.797 --> 00:02:26.273
No government ID

64
00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.118
or application is required

65
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.402
Simply download a wallet

66
00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:32.078
and you are ready to earn

67
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.353
spend and save money worldwide

68
00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:37.527
Crypto transactions are pseudonymous

69
00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.127
censorship-resistant

70
00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.830
fast and have low fees

71
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.269
This makes crypto perfect for

72
00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:44.623
online shopping

73
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.969
money transfers

74
00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:47.016
fundraising

75
00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.518
and brick-and-mortar stores

76
00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:50.566
Additionally you can withdraw

77
00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:52.274
crypto to physical cash

78
00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:53.971
gift cards or gold

79
00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:58.018
The tyranny of digital ID already exists

80
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.498
due to the state's monopoly on identity

81
00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:04.064
The state already refuses
to print passports

82
00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.763
national ID cards and birth certificates

83
00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:09.519
for approximately
1 billion people worldwide

84
00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:13.377
As more and more services
require government ID

85
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.410
this shuts people out from necessities

86
00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:16.319
like jobs

87
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.285
apartments

88
00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:18.334
healthcare

89
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:19.114
mail

90
00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.623
sim cards and more

91
00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:23.549
Sadly there are no alternatives

92
00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:26.666
Flag Theory requires an existing ID

93
00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:28.737
Red Cross doesn't print IDs

94
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.117
and non-government IDs aren't accepted

95
00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.956
If someone for example

96
00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.540
wasn't registered at birth

97
00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:36.811
there is no way for them to appeal

98
00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:39.053
or access ID in another way

99
00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:42.336
Government ID requirements

100
00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:44.385
also known as KYC

101
00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:46.489
have been excluding innocent people

102
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:47.151
from jobs

103
00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:48.077
housing

104
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.274
healthcare and more since decades

105
00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:53.385
Not only people who can't get ID

106
00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:55.409
but also people who need pseudonymity

107
00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:56.813
for safety reasons

108
00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:59.386
such as activists and victims of abuse

109
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.663
This artificial barrier to the economy

110
00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:05.747
is cruel, fatalistic and
puts people in danger

111
00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:07.952
No third party should be able to

112
00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:10.151
universally censor an individual

113
00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:11.316
from the entire market

114
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.353
For example

115
00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:15.702
if an employer likes
an applicant's skills

116
00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:16.587
and work ethic

117
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.021
they should be able to hire this person

118
00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:20.306
In reality

119
00:04:20.308 --> 00:04:22.194
government ID requirements

120
00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:23.345
prevent this applicant

121
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:24.916
from finding work anywhere

122
00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:26.961
despite their abilities and efforts

123
00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:28.417
Likewise

124
00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.762
if someone is ill

125
00:04:29.764 --> 00:04:30.755
goes to the doctor

126
00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:32.126
and can pay in cash

127
00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:34.667
they may be wrongly
refused treatment

128
00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.271
due to no government ID

129
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:37.675
In a free market

130
00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.953
transactions are between
the buyer and seller only

131
00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:43.129
Trades are made on the basis of

132
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.369
supply and demand

133
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:47.067
without censorship from
external gatekeepers

134
00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:50.514
Government ID requirements
are unethical

135
00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:51.975
especially as the state refuses

136
00:04:51.977 --> 00:04:54.509
to print ID for millions of people

137
00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:56.002
In comparison

138
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.287
agorism doesn't require ID

139
00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.939
and is open to everyone

140
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:03.686
Agorist KYC-free services

141
00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:05.674
don't require government ID

142
00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:06.877
or state permission

143
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.031
This provides equal and
meritocratic access

144
00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:10.912
to services

145
00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:12.316
preserves privacy

146
00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:14.863
and avoids state surveillance
and censorship

147
00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:16.830
Some examples are

148
00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:18.101
under-the-table jobs

149
00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:20.059
informal apartment rentals

150
00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:21.573
and anonymous health clinics

151
00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:24.410
Cryptocurrencies help people to

152
00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:25.791
earn money remotely

153
00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:26.870
shop online

154
00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:29.028
and send international
money transfers

155
00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:32.421
Anonymous sim cards
and PO boxes

156
00:05:32.423 --> 00:05:34.499
help people to access the internet

157
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.418
and receive mail without ID

158
00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:39.500
Proxy merchants are also useful

159
00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:42.468
Some examples of
proxy services include

160
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.818
A roommate deals with
the rental contract

161
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.874
on your behalf and
you pay them in cash

162
00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.060
A friend sends a
bank transfer for you

163
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.111
A local store allows you to

164
00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:53.392
pickup mail there

165
00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.822
A business registers sim cards

166
00:05:55.824 --> 00:05:57.237
under their company name

167
00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:58.971
and resells them anonymously

168
00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:03.979
There are many ways
to establish trust

169
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:04.922
or authorization

170
00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:06.567
without government ID

171
00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.406
many of which are
successfully used today

172
00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.787
Many transactions can be
done anonymously

173
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:13.802
for example

174
00:06:13.804 --> 00:06:17.233
buying food, clothes or
electronics in a store

175
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.712
You only need to hand over the cash

176
00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:21.405
and the product is yours

177
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.352
No name required

178
00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:25.795
PINs and passwords can help

179
00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:26.986
with authorization

180
00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:28.485
One example is

181
00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:30.536
a password to login to a website

182
00:06:30.538 --> 00:06:33.186
or a PIN sent by SMS or email

183
00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:34.395
to pick up a package

184
00:06:34.612 --> 00:06:36.625
Cryptographic key pairs

185
00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:38.544
are used for critical applications

186
00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:41.271
such as PGP encryption and signing

187
00:06:41.273 --> 00:06:42.963
for secure communication

188
00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:44.785
and proving ownership of funds

189
00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:45.671
with Bitcoin

190
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.054
A pseudonymous key pair is enough

191
00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:49.385
to prove your identity

192
00:06:49.387 --> 00:06:51.000
or send money worldwide

193
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.660
Online shopping and remote work

194
00:06:53.662 --> 00:06:55.189
can benefit from escrows

195
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.274
such as Bitcoin's multisig

196
00:06:57.706 --> 00:06:59.166
This enables refunds

197
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.484
in the case of a scam

198
00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:02.755
Cash deposits for rentals

199
00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:05.030
can protect against
damages or theft

200
00:07:05.362 --> 00:07:07.231
Customer reviews can help you to

201
00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:09.204
find trusted products or businesses

202
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.431
Vouches for example from friends

203
00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:14.001
colleagues or landlords

204
00:07:14.003 --> 00:07:15.584
and web of trust can help

205
00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:16.926
to trust individuals

206
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.595
While personal IDs are
a dangerous concept

207
00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:23.744
non-government IDs
from NGOs or companies

208
00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:25.850
are easier to access than the gatekept

209
00:07:25.852 --> 00:07:28.948
single point of failure of
government ID systems

210
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:32.691
Next to the state monopoly on money

211
00:07:32.693 --> 00:07:33.655
and identity

212
00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:35.315
is the monopoly on markets

213
00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:37.730
Via regulations

214
00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:39.965
the state censors what can be sold

215
00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:40.978
who can sell

216
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.246
and for what price

217
00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:44.423
The state excludes entire

218
00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:45.174
categories of products

219
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:46.734
and groups of sellers

220
00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:47.806
from the economy

221
00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:50.066
despite market demand
for these services

222
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.373
State regulations harm many people

223
00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:55.139
They make it difficult

224
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.386
to access medicine

225
00:07:56.388 --> 00:07:57.690
affordable housing

226
00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:59.157
or even find a job

227
00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:01.586
High taxes make it difficult

228
00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:03.963
for regular people to
afford food and rent

229
00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:06.326
while the state immorally
spends these funds

230
00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:08.884
on corporate bailouts
corruption and war

231
00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:11.071
In comparison

232
00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:13.897
unregulated markets
are open to everyone

233
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.216
without restrictions

234
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:16.909
These may be known as

235
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:17.846
gray markets

236
00:08:17.848 --> 00:08:19.290
parallel economies

237
00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:20.883
circular economies

238
00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:21.969
or Second Realms

239
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:23.765
Some examples are

240
00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:25.894
local cash-in-hand markets

241
00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:27.373
online classifieds

242
00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:28.527
and darknet markets

243
00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:31.877
Opsec and risk management
are important

244
00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:34.486
but gray markets have
operated successfully

245
00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:35.415
since decades

246
00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:37.528
even in authoritarian countries

247
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.021
and provide customers with
what they need

248
00:08:40.023 --> 00:08:41.390
and are unable to get

249
00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:42.841
from gatekept state markets

250
00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:46.173
Many day-to-day necessities

251
00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:48.221
take place as market transactions

252
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:50.753
When you earn money from your job

253
00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:52.203
pay rent for your apartment

254
00:08:52.205 --> 00:08:54.164
buy food in a grocery store

255
00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.060
and pay for a gym membership

256
00:08:56.062 --> 00:08:57.771
All these are market transactions

257
00:08:57.773 --> 00:08:59.449
between a buyer and a seller

258
00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:01.673
These market transactions

259
00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.093
take place in communities

260
00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:04.406
such as with colleagues

261
00:09:04.408 --> 00:09:05.421
neighbors

262
00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:06.821
regular customers

263
00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:09.091
friends or fellow fans
of your hobby

264
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:13.093
Local, global and online
agorist communities

265
00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:14.650
can help buyers and sellers to

266
00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:16.188
meet each other and build

267
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.537
a parallel economy
free from state control

268
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.113
Agorism doesn't require
mainstream adoption

269
00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:24.506
or integration with the
statist white market

270
00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.105
If you have one agorist employer

271
00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:28.550
one agorist landlord

272
00:09:28.552 --> 00:09:30.939
and shop from one
agorist grocery store

273
00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:31.782
that's enough

274
00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:34.163
A network of like-minded people

275
00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:35.752
and a peer-to-peer free market

276
00:09:35.754 --> 00:09:36.842
can help people to find

277
00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:37.943
what they need

278
00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:41.601
There are many ways
to participate

279
00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:42.959
in agorist markets

280
00:09:43.852 --> 00:09:45.555
The Gray Man strategy

281
00:09:45.557 --> 00:09:47.007
is when a white market business

282
00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:49.299
sells agorist services
under-the-table

283
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:50.572
to trusted customers

284
00:09:51.214 --> 00:09:52.252
For example

285
00:09:52.254 --> 00:09:54.016
a local phone repair store

286
00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:56.353
sells anonymous sim cards
on request

287
00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:58.189
or a hotel rents out rooms

288
00:09:58.191 --> 00:10:00.233
without ID to people in need

289
00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:01.963
such as victims of abuse

290
00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:03.505
or undocumented people

291
00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:05.215
A Proxy Merchant

292
00:10:05.217 --> 00:10:07.115
offers their company as a proxy

293
00:10:07.117 --> 00:10:08.008
so that people can

294
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.001
access services anonymously

295
00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:13.115
An example is a
personal shopping service

296
00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:15.827
A customer sends a
link to a product

297
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:17.151
and pays with crypto

298
00:10:17.153 --> 00:10:19.837
The personal shopper
buys the product

299
00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.039
with their bank account

300
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:22.583
and ships it to the customer

301
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.555
A Second Realm business

302
00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.984
exists entirely
outside of the state

303
00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:28.757
without a registered company

304
00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:29.876
ID or permit

305
00:10:30.432 --> 00:10:31.320
An example is

306
00:10:31.322 --> 00:10:33.933
remote freelance work
for cryptocurrency

307
00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:36.549
or selling refurbished
laptops in Craigslist

308
00:10:37.444 --> 00:10:38.656
Peer-to-peer sales

309
00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.009
are one time sales

310
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:41.851
such as subletting
your apartment

311
00:10:41.853 --> 00:10:43.820
for 1 month while
you are traveling

312
00:10:43.822 --> 00:10:45.911
or selling your
old car for cash

313
00:10:47.873 --> 00:10:49.601
Agorist markets for food include

314
00:10:49.603 --> 00:10:50.915
farmers markets

315
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.830
local non-chain stores

316
00:10:52.832 --> 00:10:55.773
crypto-friendly grocery
stores and restaurants

317
00:10:55.775 --> 00:10:58.071
and direct trade for
imported products

318
00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:00.979
You can also grow
your own food

319
00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:02.356
with a garden or homestead

320
00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:04.350
Encourage your favorite

321
00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:06.211
online and local stores

322
00:11:06.213 --> 00:11:07.459
to accept crypto

323
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:09.280
rather than only bank transfers

324
00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:10.344
or credit cards

325
00:11:11.114 --> 00:11:12.310
Make sure you use a

326
00:11:12.312 --> 00:11:14.006
KYC-free provider

327
00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:16.143
such as BTCPayServer.org

328
00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:16.967
Oshi.tech

329
00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:18.077
Bitejo.com

330
00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:19.433
or a mobile wallet

331
00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:20.974
instead of a platform that

332
00:11:20.976 --> 00:11:22.373
requires government ID

333
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:24.993
like Strike, Coinbase or Bitpay

334
00:11:26.522 --> 00:11:27.673
Agorist jobs include

335
00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:30.475
under-the-table jobs
for cash and crypto

336
00:11:30.477 --> 00:11:32.083
either as your main income

337
00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:33.026
or on the side

338
00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:36.393
Offer your services
via word-of-mouth

339
00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:39.088
Craigslist or crypto
classifieds websites

340
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.665
like Microlancer.io
or FreelanceForCoins.com

341
00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:44.989
You can exchange earned
crypto to physical cash

342
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:48.289
with Bisq, HodlHodl.com
or Bitcoin ATMs

343
00:11:49.233 --> 00:11:51.120
If you need to hire someone

344
00:11:51.122 --> 00:11:53.462
choose a freelancer
or small business

345

394
00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:29.651
and the sender and recipient

395
00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:30.731
never meet each other

396
00:13:31.459 --> 00:13:32.397
Additionally

397
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:33.554
a proxy merchant

398
00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:34.540

00:13:56.672 --> 00:13:57.752
It isn't a question of

412
00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.094
"Will Agorism Work?"

413
00:13:59.643 --> 00:14:01.255
Agorism already provides

414
00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.165
necessary services to people

415
00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:05.616
outside of state censorship
and surveillance

416
00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.069
Sellers earn profits

417
00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:09.106
save time

418
00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:10.546
avoid bureaucracy

419
00:14:10.548 --> 00:14:11.954
and bypass censorship

420
00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:13.983
and buyers can
get what they need

with cash or crypto

422
00:14:15.797 --> 00:14:18.030
There are many motivations for this

423
00:14:18.032 --> 00:14:20.086
such as saving money and time

424
00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:21.542
avoiding red tape

425
00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:22.973
financial inclusion

426
00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:23.831

428
00:14:24.726 --> 00:14:27.447
humanitarian or
ideological reasons

429
00:14:28.332 --> 00:14:29.552
Gray markets work

430
00:14:29.554 --> 00:14:31.137
have worked since decades

431
00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:32.657
and will continue to work

432
00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:34.023
wherever they are needed

433
00:14:35.293 --> 00:14:36.348

Buy from small businesses

and peer-to-peer markets

437
00:14:41.765 --> 00:14:43.947
instead of state-backed
corporations

438
00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:46.596
Encourage your favorite stores

439
